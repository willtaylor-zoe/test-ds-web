## ðŸ‘‹ Introduction

Here's the [Figma link](https://www.figma.com/design/emycBlnyKjfXwW9K6pKvsh/%E2%9C%85-LBR%3A-Web-design-system?node-id=1096-69537&m=dev) for the ZOE Web Design System [WIP].

## ðŸ“š How it works

- Components use [React ARIA components](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/components.html) under the hood where relevant (apart from Form - see below).
- Form components (DSInput, DSForm) uses Formik since that's what we use to create checkout forms at the moment.
  - We probably want to move away from Formik longer term, to use a more modern, lightweight library, but I didn't want us to make this big change now.
- DSForm is essentially the Formik form wrapper. It accepts children, which will likely comprise DSInput and DSButton.

## ðŸ“¦ How to use

The package is published to GitHub Packages. To use it in your project, you need to add/update your `.npmrc`:

```
//npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken={{ GITHUB_TOKEN }}
@zoe:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com
```

Where `{{ GITHUB_TOKEN }}` is a GitHub Personal Access Token with `read:packages` scope (See [Managing your personal access tokens](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens)).

Then, you can install the package:

```
npm install @zoe/ds-web
```

## ðŸš€ Principles to help you get started

- You shouldn't define margins in your components. Use DSSpacer instead.
- You shouldn't need to create a div just to create a flexbox . Use DSFlex instead.
- You shouldn't create p tags with text. Use DSText instead.
- DSButton and DSLinkButton have the same styles (i.e. to look like buttons), but DSLinkButton is a `a` tag under the hood (via NextJS's Link component + React ARIA's Link component).
- Ideally, responsive styling based on viewport size shouldn't happen at an individual component level, but at a page level (this assumes well structured use of CSS variables at a component level).
- There are more Design System components to come. These are listed in the [Growth Linear board](https://linear.app/joinzoe/project/design-system-web-46e307dbb4d0/issues).

## ðŸ’¡ Tips

- If you use VSCode, download the extension [Styled Global Variables Autocomplete](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yeion7.styled-global-variables-autocomplete) to help with CSS variables autocompletion. Ensure you have a file in `.vscode/settings.json` with the following:
  ```json
  {
    "variablesAutocomplete.include": "**/styles/**/*Styles.ts"
  }
  ```
